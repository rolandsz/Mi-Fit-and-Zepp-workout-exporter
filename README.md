# Mi Fit and Zepp workout exporter

This repository contains an example Python implementation for the [article](https://rolandszabo.com/reverse-engineering/mi-fit/export-mi-fit-and-zepp-workout-data).

## Environment setup
The script depends on the `requests` package.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The script downloads all workout data and it also creates corresponding .gpx files for convenience.

```bash
python3 main.py [-h] -t TOKEN [-e ENDPOINT] [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]
```

## Acknowledgements 
The .gpx conversion is based on Miroslav Bend√≠k's [MiFitDataExport](https://github.com/mireq/MiFitDataExport) project.
